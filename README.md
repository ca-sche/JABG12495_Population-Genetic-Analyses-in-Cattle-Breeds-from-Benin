This repository will contain scripts and programs (mainly written in R) developed for our research article "The role of agro‚Äêecological factors and transboundary transhumance in shaping the genetic diversity in four indigenous cattle populations of Benin" published in the Journal of Animal Breeding and Genetics in July 2020.

I will update the repository and its contents step by step from now on. If you are interested in specific analyses or applications in context of the published work prior to their release here, please feel free to contact me: carsten.scheper@agrar.uni-giessen.de
